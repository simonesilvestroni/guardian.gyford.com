# "Today's Guardian" by Phil Gyford custom CSS

The [website](https://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2010/06/09/todays-guardian/) shows all the articles from todayâ€™s issue of [_The Guardian_](https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian) or, on Sundays, [_Observer_](https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver) newspapers. It is run by [Phil Gyford](https://www.gyford.com/) and uses the [Guardian Open Platform](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/). A new issue appears around midnight UK time. The code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/philgyford/daily-paper).

My custom CSS is handled through the [extension Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) on (in my case) Firefox.

Featuring the same typography used of other interfaces I've been using:

- Seravek for headings and UI elements
- Iowan Old Style for body copy
